        <p class="description">
          Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), founded by Harland Sanders in 1930, is a
          globally recognized fast-food chain renowned for its signature fried
          chicken, which is seasoned with a secret blend of 11 herbs and spices
          developed by Sanders himself. The company's journey began with a
          roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression,
          and it officially launched its franchising model in 1952, marking the
          beginning of its rapid expansion across the United States. KFC's
          iconic brand identity, anchored by the image of Colonel Sanders and
          the slogan "Finger Lickin' Good," has remained a cornerstone of its
          marketing strategy, contributing significantly to its widespread
          recognition and enduring appeal.
